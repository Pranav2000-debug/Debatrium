PHASE 1 — Document-aware Debate Coaching (DO THIS FIRST)
What :-
Let users work with the AI on their own debate:
“Help me improve weakness #2”
“Strengthen my opening”
“Rewrite this paragraph more formally”
“Give me a rebuttal to this criticism”
This is not RAG.
This is context-aware prompting.
Uses what you already have (PDF + analysis)
Immediate SaaS value
Feels like a “debate coach”
No infra complexity
No hallucination risk

REQUIREMENT: 
✅ Extracted & sanitized document text
✅ AI analysis output (strengths/weaknesses)
➕ Chunking (to fit context window)
➕ A “document-aware chat” prompt
What NOT needed:
❌ Vector DB
❌ Embeddings
❌ RAG


PHASE 2 — Chunking (ENABLES PHASE 1)
What
Split the PDF text into manageable chunks so the AI:
Sees relevant parts only
Stays within token limits
Gives focused answers

Why:
Long PDFs won’t fit in one prompt
Refinements need local context
Chunking = control

Requirements:
Chunk size: 800–1200 tokens
Overlap: 150–200 tokens

Store:

{
  pdfId,
  chunkIndex,
  text
}

What NOT needed
❌ Embeddings
❌ Semantic search
manually select relevant chunks based on the weakness/topic.


PHASE 3 — External “Relevant Resources” (OPTIONAL NEXT)
What

Show articles / reports / studies related to the debate topic.

Why

Improves credibility

Helps users research

Complements debate prep

Requirements

Detected topic (you already have this)

Simple search API (news / scholarly)

Ranking + display

What NOT needed (initially)

❌ RAG
❌ Feeding articles back into AI

Just show links.


PHASE 4 — True RAG (DO LATER)
What

Use embeddings + vector search so AI can:

Answer questions grounded in documents

Reference specific passages

Compare across PDFs

Why

Cross-document reasoning

Source-backed answers

Memory across sessions

Requirements

Chunking (already done)

Embeddings model

Vector DB (Pinecone / Qdrant / etc.)

Retrieval + citation logic


👉 What to do FIRST

PHASE 1 + PHASE 2 together

Document-aware debate coaching using chunking

This gives:

Immediate product value

Clean UX

No infra pain

One-line mental model

Chunking = context control
RAG = knowledge retrieval

You need context control first.
